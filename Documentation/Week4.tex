\section{Task 1}
This first section required the near-Gaussian graph generated from last week to be re-imported into the code for this week so it could be compared with the expected values, and a second method for creating a Gaussian histogram which used the \textbf{java.util.Random} class to generate random Gaussian values. This was done by creating another Histogram instance with identical parameters on line 24 and adding into the for-loop used for filling the histograms a separate section for the second histogram which had to scale the randomly generated Gaussian value by $0.5$ as the default values produced have a standard deviation of 1 and was done on lines 37 and 38 and then printed to console and to a .csv file with lines 44 and 45.

24 Histogram nextGaussHist = new Histogram(50, -2, 2);

37 double value_next = randGen.nextGaussian()*0.5;
38 nextGaussHist.fill(value_next);
44 nextGaussHist.print();                            
45 nextGaussHist.writeToDisk("nextgauss_test.csv");

The output data was then put into the same spreadsheet, and had their graphs overlayed upon the same axis together with the expected
